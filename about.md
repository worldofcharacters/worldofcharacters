## About Me

Hi! I'm **WorldOfCharacters**, a 14-year-old girl from Fort Worth, Texas.

I love drawing and creating comics! I also paint with watercolors. 

Some of my favorite things include:

- **A Bug's Life**
- **Wednesday**
- **Smiling Critters**
- **The Grinch**
- **How To Train Your Dragon**
- **Five Nights at Freddies**
- **Stranger Things**

Thanks for checking out my comics!
